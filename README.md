http://www.ece.tufts.edu/ee/194HHW/papers/01617246.pdf  and https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/379e/e00a4ae24e6d50e76fbb9f8150ae99168ac3.pdf are two papers which were referred. 
 
The folder "Code for Fall Detection" contains Arduino code for fall detection based on a 3 axis Accelerometer and a 3 axis Gyroscope both present in a single IMU chip MPU-6050. The code detects a fall and sends an alert to an android phone via bluetooth.
 
 The android phone showed data in a simple application made using MIT App Inventor http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/
