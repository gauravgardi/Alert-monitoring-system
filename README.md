01617246.pdf and falldetection-bsn09.pdf are two paper which were referred. 
 
The folder "Code for Fall Detection" contains Arduino code for fall detection based on a 3 axis Accelerometer and a 3 axis Gyroscope both present in a single IMU chip MPU-6050. The code detects a fall and sends an alert to an android phone via bluetoth.
